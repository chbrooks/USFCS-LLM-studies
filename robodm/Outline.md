# Robo-DM

### Objective

Using AI, generate a story plotline and then generate scenes and characters to populate the plotline, simply and interactively. Users may select from famous works to take inspiration from (“I want my story and world to be like Lord of the Rings.”), select genres and tropes (“I want it to be more of a dark fantasy cerebral horror / thriller.”), and enter prompt text to first generate a plotline; then they may alter the plot line in-place, request a rewrite with an optional prompt (“More HORROR”), and, when happy with the plot, have the AI generate scenarios and scenes for plot points.
The initial motivation for this project is to make a resource for people who want to create their own story and world for personal use in a tabletop RPG like Dungeons and Dragons.

### Learning Goals

Experience with complex AI and tools used therewithin. Specifically, exploring NLP technologies, multi-dimensional prompts, AI output -> human editing -> AI input cycles, and structured input / output for LLM's.

### Tools

Python, TensorFlow?

### Milestones

1. Rough-draft python script for a plot generator with one of the following inputs: inspirational works, genre, text\nDue: 10/06
2. Refine plot generator and implement more input dimensions\nDue: 10/27
3. Refine plot generator and implement human editing and AI rewrite\nDue: 11/10
4. World / Scene generation for plot points\nDue: 12/1
